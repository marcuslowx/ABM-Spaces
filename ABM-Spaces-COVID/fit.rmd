## Calibration outputs
The below is based on `r runs_count` runs of the base scenario.

```{R R0_detect, echo = FALSE}
mean_r <- mean(fit$R0)

```

Here are the mean and IQR calculations to be used in the article. The mean here is the mean of all years in all runs of the model's base scenario - same with the IQR.

Mean R0: `r mean_r` 

Where agents get infected

Based on a TB study that we are using to calibrate the model, we want the following spread of TB infections by space:

Home 15.6, work 41.4, school 10.2, block 10.9, taxi 21.9 

```{R percentages_non_intervention, echo = FALSE}
jj <- fit
percentages <- data.frame("Home" = mean(jj$Home), "Work" = mean(jj$Work), "School" = mean(jj$School), "Block" = mean(jj$Block), "Taxi" = mean(jj$Taxi))
percentages <- prop.table(percentages)
percentages <- round(percentages * 100, digits=1)
htmlTable(percentages)

jj <- select(jj, c("Home", "Work", "School", "Block", "Taxi")) 

jj <- prop.table(data.matrix(jj), 1)

jj <- as.data.frame(jj)

home_v <- round(unname(quantile(jj$Home)), digit=3)*100
work_v <- round(unname(quantile(jj$Work)), digit=3) *100
school_v <- round(unname(quantile(jj$School)), digit=3) *100
block_v <- round(unname(quantile(jj$Block)), digit=3) *100
taxi_v <- round(unname(quantile(jj$Taxi)), digit=3) *100
```

And here it is with quantiles.

Home
`r home_v`

Work
`r work_v`

School
`r school_v`

Block
`r block_v`

Taxi
`r taxi_v`
